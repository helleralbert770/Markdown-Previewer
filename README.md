# Markdown Previewer

A simple Markdown Previewer built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input Markdown text in a textarea, and it automatically renders the Markdown as HTML in real-time in a preview area.

## Features

- **Real-time preview**: As you type Markdown in the editor, the preview area updates immediately.
- **Markdown support**: Supports a variety of Markdown elements such as headings, lists, links, code blocks, images, and more.
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: It supports the GitHub-flavored markdown syntax.

## User Stories

- **User Story #1**: I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
- **User Story #2**: I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
- **User Story #3**: When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
- **User Story #4**: When I enter GitHub-flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.
- **User Story #5**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a subheading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
- **User Story #6**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
